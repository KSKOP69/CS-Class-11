""" Block and Indentation """

'''
Block: A block is a group of statements that are executed together as a single unit. Block of code begins when a statement ends with a colon (:) and is followed by an indented set of statements.

Indentation: Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define the scope of a block. Python relies on consistent indentation to determine the beginning and end of blocks.
